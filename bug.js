This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue arises when you try to access the `width` or `height` properties of the `window` object returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` before the layout has been completely measured. This often leads to undefined or incorrect values.

**Problematic Code:**
```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  console.log('Width:', width); // May be undefined or incorrect
  console.log('Height:', height);
  return (
    <View style={{ width, height }}/>
  );
};
```
